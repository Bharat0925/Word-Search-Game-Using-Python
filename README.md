The Word Search game is a classic puzzle game that involves finding specific words hidden within a grid of letters. The grid is usually square or rectangular, and the words can be hidden horizontally, vertically, diagonally, or even backward within the grid. The words to be found are typically listed alongside the grid.

Here are the basic steps of playing a Word Search game:

1. **Grid Generation:**
   - A grid of letters is generated, and random letters are filled in the remaining spaces to disguise the hidden words.
   - The words to be found are chosen and hidden within the grid.

2. **Word List:**
   - A list of words to find is provided to the player. This list usually includes words related to a theme or category (e.g., animals, colors, programming languages).

3. **Finding Words:**
   - The player looks for the hidden words within the grid.
   - Words can be oriented in any direction: horizontally from left to right or right to left, vertically from top to bottom or bottom to top, and diagonally.

4. **Marking Words:**
   - When a player finds a word, they usually mark it by circling or highlighting the letters that form the word.

5. **Completion:**
   - The game is completed when all the words in the list are found.
